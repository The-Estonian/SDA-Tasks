"""Write a program that reads the text entered by the user, and then:

checks if the word "Python" appears in the text - if so, it prints the message "I found Python" in the console,
checks if the text starts with the word "Python" - if so, it prints the message "Starts with Python" in the console,
check if the text ends with the word "Python" - if so, it prints the message "Ends with Python" in the console,
checks if the text equals the word "Python" - if so, prints the message "Equals Python" in the console,
prints the index of the first occurrence of the word "Python" in the text in the console.
For example, for the text "Python", the program should write in the console:

I found Python
Starts with Python
Ends with Python
Equals Python
0
and for the text 'Python course from scratch is the best way to learn Python', the program should write in the console:

I found Python
Ends with Python
54
